# ESP_AUDIO_CODEC

Espressif Audio Codec (ESP_AUDIO_CODEC) is the official audio encoding and decoding processing module developed by Espressif Systems for SoCs. 

The ESP Audio Encoder provides a common encoder interface that allows you to register multiple encoders, such as AAC, AMR-NB, AMR-WB, ADPCM, G711A, G711U, PCM, OPUS, ALAC. User can create one or multiple encoder instances based on the encoder interfaces, these instances can run simultaneous encoding. Meanwhile user can also call specified encoder API directly to have less call depth. 

The ESP Audio Decoder provides a common decoder interface that allows you to register multiple decoders, such as AAC, MP3, AMR-NB, AMR-WB, ADPCM, G711A, G711U, VORBIS, OPUS, ALAC. You can create one or multiple decoder instances using the provided interfaces, enabling simultaneous decoding. Meanwhile user can also call specified decoder API directly to have less call depth. ESP Audio Decoder can only process audio frame data (which means input data is frame boundary).

To simplify the decoding process for parsing and locating audio frames, we utilize the ESP Audio Simple Decoder. This decoder employs a parser to easily and conveniently aggregate and structure audio frames, which are subsequently decoded using the ESP Audio Decoder. Users can input data of varying lengths. Supported audio containers include AAC, MP3, WAV, FLAC, AMRNB, AMRWB, M4A.

# Highlights

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  The ESP Audio Codec module features a user-friendly interface designed for simple usability.
  
- **Lightweight with High Performance**  
  The module is optimized for high performance while maintaining a lightweight footprint and minimal memory usage.
  
- **Dual-Level Decoder API**  
  User can use ESP Audio Decoder when input data already at frame boundary, or use ESP Audio Simple Decoder to process any input length of data. Both decoder provide similar APIs make it easy to transition between them.
  
- **High Customization through Registration**  
  Through registration API, user can add customized decoder, encoder or simple decoder easily, meanwhile user can overwrite the default decoder or encoder without change for application code.

# Performance

The following results are tested and gathered on ESP32-S3R8 platform. The data can be obtained by running `Encode to Decode chain test` in the test code, sample log output is as follow:
```
I (12599) CODEC_TEST: Start to do chain test for AAC sample_rate 48000 channel 2
I (12879) DEC_TEST: Encoder for AAC cpu: 12.91%
I (12880) DEC_TEST: Encoder AAC compress ratio: 5.86% heap usage: 51400
I (12914) DEC_TEST: Decode for AAC cpu: 6.75% heap usage: 51168
```
To get performance under other sample rate, channel or complexity, please change the parameters in the test codes ( mainly located in function `chain_test_thread` and `get_encoder_config` ).

**Notes:**   
Encoder cpu usage is highly dependent on certain encoding settings (like bitrate or complexity)  
 1) For AAC encoder, tested under bitrate 90kbps
 2) For AMR-NB and AMR-WB encoders, test bitrate under ARM-NB: 12.2kbps, ARM-WB: 8.85kbps.
 3) For OPUS encoder test bitrate set as 90kbps, complexity set as 0.
 4) Memory usage only consider heap usage, stack usage is not included, to support all encoders the running on stack size should about 40k.

**Notes:** 
 1) MP3 and FLAC decoders are tested with real audio data. All other codes are tested with encoded data from sin wav PCM. 
 2) For AAC decoder, tested file is encoded in AAC-LC profile, decoding AAC-Plus profile will have higher memory and CPU usage.
 3) Only the heap usage is considered here. To support all decoders, the task running the decoder should have stack size of about 20K.
